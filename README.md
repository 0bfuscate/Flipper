    Download .IR file in the Flipper Repo. (1 file = All ATV's)
          Connect Flipper to Computer and run qFlipper.
     Transfer .IR File to any location within SDCard/Infrared.

Special thanks to the people who made this $6 Apple TV IR only Remote clone.
All OEM Apple remotes (ATV4/4K) only send vol+/vol- IR singals the rest is BLE.
Somehow they figured out the IR commands for the newer Apple TV models and I appreciate it, Thank you.

EDIT: Added all .IR files for all generations of Apple TV.
